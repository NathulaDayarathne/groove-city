                            <i><b> Old School Hip Hop </b></i> is the pioneering era of hip-hop music that emerged in the 1970s and continued through the mid-1980s. 
                            It is characterized by minimalistic beats, sampled loops from funk and soul records, and the use of turntablism and DJ techniques. 
                            MCs (rappers) delivered rhythmic and often light-hearted lyrics, while block parties and B-Boy culture were essential elements of the movement. 
                            Old School Hip Hop set the stage for the diverse and influential genre we know today.
